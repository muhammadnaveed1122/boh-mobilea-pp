/**
 * "Continue with Google" button. Built on the shared Button atom (outline
 * variant, size lg, rounded-2xl) so it is pixel-identical in width, height and
 * corner radius to the primary Sign In button it stacks under.
 *
 * Google's branding guidelines require the multi-color "G" mark to keep its
 * official colors and proportions — rendered here as an inline SVG (not
 * recolored or rebuilt). The previous pre-rendered "rd_ctn" image had a fixed
 * ~4.5:1 aspect ratio that letterboxed inside a full-width button, hence the
 * custom layout.
